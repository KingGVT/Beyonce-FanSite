						<h2 id = "parallaxcaption"> 4 </h2>
						<p id = "parallaxtext" style = "padding-top: 30px"> <strong>4</strong> is the fourth studio album by American singer Beyoncé. It was released on June 24, 2011 by Parkwood Entertainment 
						and Columbia Records. Following a career hiatus that reignited her creativity, Beyoncé was inspired to create a record with a basis in traditional rhythm and blues 
						that stood apart from contemporary popular music. Her collaborations with songwriters and record producers The-Dream, Tricky Stewart and Shea Taylor produced a mellower 
						tone, developing diverse vocal styles and influences from funk, hip hop, and soul music. Severing professional ties with father and manager Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé eschewed 
						the music of her previous releases in favor of an intimate, personal album. 4's lyrics emphasize monogamy, female empowerment and self-reflection, a result of Beyoncé 
						considering a maturer message to contend artistic credibility. In May 2011, Beyoncé submitted seventy-two songs to Columbia Records for consideration, twelve of which 
						appeared on the standard edition. 4 was promoted in mid-2011 by television performances and festival appearances, such as Beyoncé's headlining Glastonbury Festival set. 
						The album received generally positive reviews by music critics; several publications included it on their year-end lists. It was her fourth consecutive album to debut at 
						number one on the US Billboard 200, and it also reached number one in Brazil, France, Ireland, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 4 spawned the 
						international singles "Run the World (Girls)", "Best Thing I Never Had", "Party", "Love on Top" and "Countdown". "Love on Top" won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional 
						R&B Performance at the 55th annual ceremony. As of December 2015, 4 has sold 1.5 million copies in the United States. </p>

						<h2 id = "parallaxcaption"> Development </h2>
						<p id = "parallaxtext"> Following the release of her third album I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008) and a world tour, Beyoncé took a career hiatus in 2010 "to live life [and] 
						to be inspired by things again". During her hiatus, she "killed" Sasha Fierce, the alter-ego used in her previous studio album, as she felt she could now merge her two 
						personalities. She severed professional ties with father and manager Mathew Knowles, who had guided her career since the 1990s with Destiny's Child, noting that the 
						decision made her feel vulnerable. In an interview for Complex, Beyoncé expressed dissatisfaction with contemporary radio. She intended 4 to help change that status, 
						commenting, "Figuring out a way to get R&B back on the radio is challenging ... With 4, I tried to mix R&B from the '70s and the '90s with rock 'n' roll and a lot of 
						horns to create something new and exciting. I wanted musical changes, bridges, vibrata, live instrumentation and classic songwriting." On her website she wrote, 
						"The album is definitely an evolution. It's bolder than the music on my previous albums because I'm bolder. The more mature I become and the more life experiences 
						I have, the more I have to talk about. I really focused on songs being classics, songs that would last, songs that I could sing when I'm 40 and when I'm 60." 
						Beyoncé also sought to make more artistic music, rather than purely commercially oriented songs. Although much of 4's inspiration came from "touring, travelling, 
						watching rock bands and attending festivals", the album's early musical direction was influenced by Nigerian Afrobeat musician Fela Kuti, whose passion for music 
						motivated Beyoncé. She worked with the band from Fela!, the Broadway musical based on Kuti's life. DJ Swivel, one of 4's engineers, later described how Kuti's use 
						of percussion and horns influenced the track "End of Time". In 2015, The-Dream revealed that he and Beyoncé had composed a whole album based on Kuti's music, although 
						this was scrapped in favor of creating 4, therefore explaining how "End of Time" became so heavily influenced. She also found additional influences in Earth, Wind & Fire, 
						The Stylistics, Lauryn Hill, Stevie Wonder, and Michael Jackson. She used hip hop for a "broader sound" and looked to bring soul singing back, stating, "I used a lot of 
						the brassiness and grittiness in my voice that people hear in my live performances, but not necessarily on my records." </p>

						<h2 id = "parallaxcaption"> Recording </h2>
						<p id = "parallaxtext"> Three months into her hiatus in March 2010, Beyoncé began recording at her husband Jay-Z's Roc the Mic Studios in New York City. 
						One song—"Party"—was recorded because she wanted to see what working relationship would develop with engineer DJ Swivel. Kanye West assisted the production of "Party" 
						after Beyoncé was impressed by his work on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010). André 3000, the only featured artist on 4, contributed a rap verse to the song, which 
						he recorded in Georgia. Six weeks later, in May 2010, she asked Swivel to work on the entire project. Concerning his working relationship with Beyoncé, he commented, 
						"There was no 'We're doing this today.' It was a very kind of open project, where whatever she felt like recording at that time was what we'd work on. It was based on how 
						she felt, her mood, and also her listening to the demos that writers would give us."[10] With Swivel, she experimented with horns, drums, guitars and percussion instruments. 
						Mostly inspired by the Fela! sessions, Swivel began to formulate beats using their own recordings and those from Fela! The project was moved to KMA Studios for a week and a 
						half because Roc the Mic was not large enough. There they began recording "I Care", "Best Thing I Never Had" and "Rather Die Young", and completed "Party". They recorded the 
						songs "Schoolin' Life", "1+1" and "Start Over" at Jungle City Studios in New York. MSR Studios was the final New York City-based studio used, and where most of 4 was recorded—only 
						"Party" and "I Was Here" were recorded entirely at other studios. At MSR, Beyoncé emphasized the use of live instruments on songs such as "I Care" and "End of Time". Consequently, 
						most of the instruments, including drums, keyboards, guitar and bass work, were recorded there and performed by Jeff Bhasker and Shea Taylor. Beyoncé asked Frank Ocean to write 
						and record "I Miss You" at MSR, saying to Complex, "[Jay-Z] had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn. I noticed his tone, his arrangements, and his 
						storytelling. I immediately reached out to him—literally the next morning. I asked him to fly to New York and work on my record." </p>

						<p id = "parallaxtext" style = "padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 0px"> After listening to each song, Beyoncé would often request the addition of specific instruments, leaving her 
						production team to make the sounds cohesive. Her vocals were recorded through an Avalon Design 737 preamp and compressed in a 1176 Peak Limiter with a 4:1 ratio. After recording 
						the lead vocals for a track, Swivel cut them in different ways and he and Beyoncé picked the best, then recording the backing vocals. Beyoncé composed her own vocal arrangements 
						and harmonies for each song. Her microphones were carefully placed to achieve a blend of sounds with a clear quality. Swivel spoke of her work ethic in an interview for Sound on Sound: </p>
						<blockquote style = "padding: 10px 25px; font-style: italic">
							She's so fast and good at what she does that you can't afford to waste time on anything, so if we're ready to record drums, 
							for example, we're going to work with whatever we have available right there and then. That's why we worked in such great 
							studios, because we know they have great gear, and we don't need to worry about renting gear. Part of my job as an engineer 
							is to make sure the sessions are not only moving along, but moving along at her pace.
						</blockquote> 
						<p id = "parallaxtext"> After the move to MSR, Beyoncé and her production team began travelling. In the United Kingdom, they worked at Peter Gabriel's Real 
						World Studios in Wiltshire—particularly using Gabriel's multi-instrument room—to create "Love on Top". Soon after, Beyoncé joined Jay-Z in a Sydney mansion, as 
						he was working on his collaboration album Watch the Throne (2011) with Kanye West. There they created a "primitive studio" using a microphone, a rig out and Pro Tools 
						software to record. Sessions were also held in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Honolulu. In February 2011, MTV reported the project was nearing completion. 4 was 
						mixed mostly at MixStar Studios in Virginia and mastered at Sterling Sound in New York City. The audio mastering was delayed by a week following the unexpected recording 
						of "I Was Here". Diane Warren had played the song to Jay-Z during a telephone conversation, leading him to put Warren and Beyoncé in contact. In May 2011, Beyoncé submitted 
						seventy-two songs in preparation for the album's release. According to Swivel, an eclectic range of songs were recorded, including ballads, "weird ethereal things" and 
						1990's R&B and Afrobeat-inspired songs. Columbia Records were reportedly overwhelmed with the "sheer volume of material she presented to them". </p>

						<h2 id = "parallaxcaption"> Music and lyrics </h2>
						<p id = "parallaxtext"> The final cut of 4 comprises twelve tracks on the standard edition and eighteen on the deluxe edition—three of which are remixes of "Run the World (Girls)". 
						Critics viewed 4 as a major departure from Beyoncé's previous catalogue, with a distinctive mellower sound. The album consists mostly of mid-tempo R&B songs, with 1970s funk, 
						1980s pop and 1990s soul influences. The second half was more eclectic, exploring a variety of genres including hard rock, reggae and adult contemporary. The Guardian complimented 
						the album's divergence from the "layering [of] Euro-synths on pop-step woomphs" that characterize the music of Beyoncé's contemporaries. The balladry of the first half of 4 
						combines diverse vocal styles with the use of live instrumentation. "1+1" demonstrates Beyoncé's vocal-flexing over "magnificent guitar bombast"[24] and a soft backing beat, while 
						"Start Over", a mid tempo R&B ballad, uses a futuristic beat with electric elements and synthesizers. "I Miss You", with its "layers of atmospheric keyboards", ambient synthesizers 
						and tinny 808 drums was sung in a half-whisper to exhibit intense emotion. "I Was Here", an understated pop-R&B ballad with indie rock inflections, primarily concerns self-reflection 
						with dramatic vocals. On other songs, Beyoncé explores womanhood. "Best Thing I Never Had", 4's fourth track, was described as a moment of self-realization and a "female call to arms". 
						With vocals that allude to a "wounded bird turned resilient lioness", the song is built on a "winkly piano riff and beefy bass drums". "Dance for You" conveys a more sexual tone through 
						breathy vocals and blaring electric guitars. It forgoes her typical empowerment themes in favor of sensual imagery and comfort with one's partner. "Run the World (Girls)", a 
						female empowerment anthem reminiscent of Beyoncé's more contemporary work on I Am... Sasha Fierce, uses an energetic sample of Major Lazer's "Pon de Floor". The song incorporates 
						"layered melodics", most prominently a military marching drumbeat, while Beyoncé's near-chanted delivery encompasses her full vocal range. </p>

						<p id = "parallaxtext" style = "padding-top: 30px"> The tracks "Countdown" and "End of Time" were distinguished by their musical and lyrical experimentalism. "Countdown" was described as 
						"everywhere on the genre map", although predominantly dancehall-led with a "bristling brass arrangement". Its chorus describes a relationship by counting backwards from ten, using a 
						sample from Boyz II Men's "Uhh Ahh". "End of Time"'s pulsating, brass sound—reminiscent of a marching-band—was heavily influenced by Afrobeat musician Fela Kuti. Kuti's use of horns and 
						percussion instruments was recreated and combined with elements of electronic music and synthesizers. "Lay Up Under Me" is also built on retro horns, featuring upbeat vocals, a sound Ryan 
						Dombal of Pitchfork associated with Michael Jackson's 1979 album Off the Wall. Other tracks were noted for their retro stylization. "Rather Die Young" is a throwback to 1960s doo-wop and 
						Philadelphia soul,[39] with a slow tempo and modern drums. "Party" achieves a vintage aesthetic through minimalistic production, replete with heavy synthesizers and a 1980s smooth-funk groove. 
						The song is unique for its conversation-like structure, in which Beyoncé and guest-vocalist André 3000 sing verses that allude to socialization at parties. Elements of Prince's style was 
						found on "Schoolin' Life" and "I Care". "Schoolin' Life" is an uptempo funk song, with lyrics that advise the listener to live life to the fullest while cautioning them about the consequences of excess. 
						The chorus of "I Care" was compared to "Purple Rain", with themes of sadness and resentment, the song uses soft background vocals and dense percussion. "Love on Top" was noted for its energetic key 
						changes with a joyful tone, evoking the work of Michael and Janet Jackson. Its retro sound is marked by a melding of horns as well as sweet backing harmonies that are most prominent on its bridge and chorus. </p>

						<h2 id = "parallaxcaption"> Release and promotion </h2>
						<p id = "parallaxtext"> On May 18, 2011, 4's release date in the United States was confirmed on to be June 28. On June 7, the album was leaked onto the Internet in full; Beyonce's 
						legal representatives issued warnings to infringing websites and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. On June 9, Beyonce responded to the leak through Facebook, 
						commenting, "My music was leaked and while this is not how I wanted to present my new songs, I appreciate the positive response from my fans. When I record music I always
						think about my fans singing every note and dancing to every beat. I make music to make people happy and I appreciate that everyone has been so anxious to hear my new songs."
						Following the leak, reports circulated that Columbia Records executives hoped to cover their assets in fear that the album may be a commercial failure. Rumors had suggested that
						the label requested from Beyonce to make changes to the record and reunite Destiny's Child, claims Columbia denied. In August 2013, NME reported that Sony Music were suing a
						47-year-old man from Gothenburg for US$233,000 concerning the leak of 4. The deluxe version was released simultaneously with the standard edition in several countries. In the 
						United States, it was available exclusively through Target stores. In an interview for Billboard, Beyonce stated that despite having another concept for the album, she was 
						ultimately influenced by her fans to name the album 4. She described the number four as being "special" to her, as her and Jay-Z's birthday, several other family and friends'
						birthdays, and her wedding anniversary fall on the fourth day of the month. The cover of the standard edition was revealed on Beyonce's website on May 18, 2011. Shot on the
						rooftop of the Hotel Meurice in Paris, Beyonce is looking into the distance with her arms raised over her head, wearing smokey eye makeup, thick gold cuffs and a fox-fur 
						stole by cult French designer Alexandre Vauthier, embellished with Swarovski crystals by the Lesage embroidery house. The cover of the deluxe version was shown on June 16, 
						where Beyonce is dressed in a tight-fitting blue-purple dress by French designer Maxime Simoens, holding her hands in her hair. For its artwork, she opted for clothing made
						by lesser-known designers. The promotional and interior-package images for 4 were shot at the same time. </p>

						<p id = "parallaxtext"> 4 received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream 
						critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 36 reviews. Michael Cragg of The Observer called it Beyonce's "most accomplished album yet".
						Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson believed 4 succeeds vocally as an album of mostly intimate and slow-tempo ballads. Mikael Wood of Spin magazine applauded its ballads, 
						mid-tempo songs, and evocations of late 1970s and early 1980s pop-soul. In his review for Rolling Stone, Jody Rosen wrote that Beyonce eschews contemporary production
						styles for a more personal and idiosyncratic album. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times viewed it as a good showcase for Beyonce as a torch singer, because she convincingly 
						sings about heartbreak and the strong emotional effect of love. Pitchfork critic Ryan Dombal found it easygoing, retro-informed, and engaging because it shows "one of the world's
						biggest stars exploring her talent in ways few could've predicted". AllMusic's Andy Kellman said that the quality of Beyonce's singing and the songwriting compensate for 
						the assorted arrangement of the songs. Uncut viewed it is an exceptional album in spite of occasionally trite lyrics. In a less enthusiastic review, Adam Markovitz of
						Entertainment Weekly said the first half of 4 is marred by boring ballads and the songwriting in general are not on-par with Beyonce's vocal talent. In his review for 
						The Guardian, Alexis Petridis was ambivalent towards the album's 1980s influence and argued that, despite well written songs, it is not very consequential.
						Time magazine's Claire Suddath said the songs lack lyrical substance, even though they are performed well. Greg Kot, writing in the Chicago Tribune, called 4 inconsistent, 
						short, and unfinished. NME magazine's Hamish MacBain felt Beyonce did not progress from her past work and that "even the OK bits here" sounded "uninspired". </p>
