						<p id = "parallaxtext" style = "padding-top: 30px"> <strong>I Am... Sasha Fierce</strong> is the third studio album by American singer Beyonce. It was released on November 18, 2008 through Columbia
						Records and Music World Entertainment. In its initial release, the album was formatted as a double album, intending to market Beyonce's contrasting facets of artistry. 
						The first disc, I Am..., contains slow and midtempo pop and R&B ballads, while the second, Sasha Fierce (named after Beyonce's on-stage alter ego), focuses on more uptempo
						beats that blend electropop and Europop genres. In composing the songs' lyrics, Beyonce worked with writers, with each session accompanied by live orchestration. Beyonce
						credited both her husband, rapper Jay-Z, and jazz singer Etta James for inspiring her to push the limits of her songwriting and artistry. Musically, I Am... drew inspiration 
						from folk and alternative rock, while blending acoustic guitar elements into contemporary ballads. The tracks on the first disc were written and produced by Beyonce, during 
						collaborative efforts with Babyface, Tricky Stewart, The-Dream and Ryan Tedder. Sasha Fierce boasted production from Darkchild and Sean Garrett. I Am... Sasha Fierce debuted 
						at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart with first-week sales of 482,000 units, earning Beyonce her third consecutive US number-one solo album. The album earned over thirty
						platinum and one diamond certifications in separate worldwide markets, being certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 16, 2009,
						selling over three million copies in the United States. As of 2016, I Am... Sasha Fierce has sold over eight million copies worldwide. The album garnered seven Grammy Award
						nominations at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards (2010) ceremony, winning five and eventually collecting a record setting six wins—the most awards won in one night by a female.
						To promote the album, Beyonce made several award show and televised appearances across Europe and America, and embarking on the worldwide I Am... World Tour (2009–10). The album 
						spawned several singles; some served as international and stateside releases, while others were purely for promotional purposes. The two lead singles from I Am... Sasha Fierce,
						"If I Were a Boy" and "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", both charted highly internationally. The former topped the charts in over eight countries and reached number
						three on the Billboard Hot 100, with the latter becoming her fifth number-one single on the Hot 100 chart. "Diva" and "Ego" were released exclusively in the United States, 
						while "Halo" and "Sweet Dreams" were promoted internationally as the third and fourth singles, respectively. "Broken-Hearted Girl" was released internationally as the fifth 
						single, while "Video Phone" was released in September 2009, and "Why Don't You Love Me" was released in July 2010 as the seventh international (ninth overall) single. </p>

					<div id = "section-recording" class = "parallaxtext">
						<h2 id = "parallaxcaption"> Recording and production </h2>
						<p id = "parallaxtext"> The recording of the album took place over an eight-month period. Beyonce recorded the album in sessions at Bangladesh Studios, PatchWerk 
						Recording Studios, Silent Sound Studios and Tree Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia; Chung King Studios, Electric Lady Studios, Roc the Mic Studios and Strawberrybee 
						Productions in New York City, New York; GAD Studios in Ibiza, Spain; Mansfield Studios and The Campground in Los Angeles, California; South Beat Studios in Miami
						Beach, Florida; and The Boom Boom Room in Burbank, California. Beyonce either co-wrote or co-produced all material on I Am... Sasha Fierce. She collaborated with 
						several record producers and songwriters, including Babyface, Stargate (production duo composed of Tor Erik Hermansen and Mikkel Storleer Eriksen), Tricky Stewart,
						The-Dream, Darkchild, Sean Garrett, Solange Knowles, Jim Jonsin, Rico Love, Ryan Tedder, Bangladesh, Ian Dench, Dave McCracken, Wayne Wilkins and Blac Elvis. Beyonce
						also collaborated with some musicians she had never worked with in the past, such as Toby Gad and BC Jean on "If I Were a Boy"; she also worked again with Amanda Ghost on 
						"Disappear". For the I Am... disc, Beyonce was influenced by folk and alternative rock genres, while incorporating other instruments she had not normally used previously,
						such as the acoustic guitar. Tedder specifically assisted Beyonce with crafting the album's balladry. The ballads were crafted in a way to combine "the best elements"
						of pop and soul music, while simultaneously "expanding the possibilities of both genres". Beyonce attempted something different as people had strong expectations from her;
						she experimented with stronger lyrics. Beyonce worked with Ghost to re-write Franz Schubert's "Ave Maria" after having co-written "Disappear" in London, England. Ghost
						told The Daily Telegraph that they were both inspired by their then-recent marriages and had walked down the aisle to "Ave Maria". </p>

					<div class = "parallaxtext">
						<p id = "parallaxtext" style = "padding-top: 30px"> During the eight-month period, Beyonce recorded over seventy songs and decided during the editing process that she did not want to 
						reconcile the two approaches into one disc. If a song was meaningless to her, she cut them off during the process of elimination for the final track listing. 
						After a process of elimination, twelve tracks were selected to be placed on the standard edition of the album, while five additional tracks were chosen to
						make the final cut for the deluxe edition of the album. Beyonce later revealed that songs from established producers like The Neptunes and Danja were not able to
						make the final cut. Making comparisons to a magazine, Beyonce further elaborated that the record was a double album and that it had two covers. The black-and-white 
						cover artworks for the standard, deluxe and platinum editions of I Am... Sasha Fierce were all shot by German photographer Peter Lindbergh. </p>

						<h2 id = "parallaxcaption"> Music and lyrics </h2>
						<p id = "parallaxtext"> In an interview for Billboard magazine, Beyonce described I Am... Sasha Fierce as a double album. She said, "One side has songs that
						are more mainstream and another has my more traditional R&B songs for my fans who've been there the whole time. Some of it sounds like Barbra Streisand, Karen 
						Carpenter and The Beatles around the 1970s." Music writer Andy Kellman of AllMusic viewed its first disc as, "essentially a small set of adult contemporary ballads.
						Acoustic guitars, pianos, strings, contemplative soul searching, and grand sweeping gestures fill it out, with more roots in '70s soft rock than soul." The second disc,
						Sasha Fierce, contains consistent electro influences, which are displayed in songs like "Radio" and "Sweet Dreams". Kellman said in his review that "Diva" resembles 
						B'Day's "Freakum Dress" or "Ring the Alarm" in terms of audacity. Despite being on the Sasha Fierce disc, "Ego", "Why Don't You Love Me" and "Scared of Lonely" 
						were noted to be a meeting ground between the album's halves. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News, they resemble Sasha Fierce musically, but thematically and
						lyrically, they are vulnerable like Beyoncé on the I Am... disc. The album formally introduces Beyonce's alter ego Sasha Fierce. She revealed that Sasha was born during the making
						of her hit single "Crazy in Love" (2003). In an interview with Emmet Sullivan of People magazine, Beyonce affirmed that her alter ego is strictly for the stage, with the editor
						describing Sasha Fierce as the singer's sensual, aggressive alter ego. </p>

					<div class = "parallaxtext">
						<p id = "parallaxtext" style = "padding-top: 30px"> "If I Were a Boy", the first single of I Am..., stands as the only song on either disc that Beyonce did not co-write. 
						BC Jean, who wrote most of the song's lyrics, took inspiration from the product of a poor relationship. Beyonce explained in Essence that "If I Were a Boy" is 
						different from her previous songs in the sense that it is not a traditional R&B song. Music critics remarked that the song seemed to be a mixture of her hit 
						single "Irreplaceable" (2006), Fergie's single "Big Girls Don't Cry" (2007), and Ciara's single "Like a Boy" (2007). Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times saw 
						the song's theme of female empowerment as an expansion on that of "Irreplaceable". Musically, "Single Ladies" is an upbeat-dance-pop and R&B song, and features 
						dancehall and bounce influences. According to Jonah Weiner of Blender, the song makes a clear reference to marriage while Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt that 
						the lyrics had a connection with "post-breakup". "Halo", composed by Ryan Tedder and Evan Bogart, was initially intended for Beyonce but was almost recorded by Leona 
						Lewis due to Beyonce's schedule. According to Christian Williams of Billboard, "Halo" has a mainstream pop sound, with subtle R&B undertones. "Ave Maria" samples Franz 
						Schubert's "Ave Maria". Critics noted "Diva" as a variation on Lil Wayne's "A Milli" and coined it as its female counterpart. "Diva" carries a stuttering beat.
						"Sweet Dreams" was critically acclaimed for its use of electronic bassline, which some critics compared to Michael Jackson's "Beat It" because of its electropop sound. 
						"Sweet Dreams" is derived from contemporary R&B and incorporates influences from the classic 1980s funk. "Broken-Hearted Girl" is a midtempo piano ballad.
						Its production and melody is backed by strings and a drum machine beat. According to Spence D. of IGN Music, "Hello" comes off like another ballad that "populate[s]
						the first part of the album." It contains the Jerry Maguire line - "You had me at hello" - as part of its chorus. It essentially consists of "sweet guitar-picking 
						and delicate harmonies." According to critics, "Video Phone" contains lyrics that are in reference to "a celebration of Skype sex and putting on a solo show, on camera, 
						for a guy you just met at the club". The remixed version featured both Beyonce and Lady Gaga trading verses with one another. Musically the song consists of simple lyrics, 
						with hidden innuendos, and is backed by thin-spread beats; Beyoncé and Gaga uttering gasps and groans while singing the song. "Disappear" consists of "sweet guitar-picking 
						and delicate harmonies". "That's Why You're Beautiful" is a slow-tempo soft rock and rock power ballad, which consists of a "grungy" guitar riff and stuterring drums.
						Critics compared the song with the materials by Alice in Chains and Jill Scott. The platinum edition of the album also included a cover version of Billy Joel's song "Honesty"
						(1979). </p>

						<p id = "parallaxtext"> I Am... Sasha Fierce was released worldwide on November 18, 2008. Deluxe edition of the album was released simultaneously with the standard edition. 
						Mathew Knowles, Beyonce's father and then-manager, held a listening party for the album in New York City on October 22, 2008. On June 16, 2009, Above and Beyonce: Video 
						Collection & Dance Mixes was released as a combined CD and DVD. The release included a CD of dance remixes to the singles of the album (including the remix of "Ego" with 
						rapper Kanye West) and the DVD features videos previously released for these singles. Finally, the platinum edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce was released in a list of 
						selected countries in September 2009, featuring a CD and a DVD. It included a cover version of Billy Joel's song "Honesty" (1979). The deluxe edition of the album was 
						re-issued in the United States on November 23, 2009, including all of the previously released songs in addition to the new songs "Poison", "Why Don't You Love Me", and 
						the remix of "Video Phone" with Lady Gaga. An extended play (EP) titled I Am...Sasha Fierce – the Bonus Tracks was released the same day, in several countries featuring 
						aforementioned three new songs. In February 2010, the bonus track from the album's multiple re-releases, "Why Don't You Love Me", which served as a promotional single, 
						climbed up the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart, eventually taking the top spot and becoming Beyoncé's thirteenth number-one dance hit. On May 4, 2010, a full-length music 
						video appeared online after its release as a promotional single. </p>

						<h2 id = "parallaxcaption"> Critical reception </h2>
						<p id = "parallaxtext"> I Am... Sasha Fierce received mixed reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream 
						publications, the album received an average score of 62, based on 24 reviews. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani wrote that the album's "strength" is "its individual songs 
						... a testament to Beyonce as one of today's most reliable singles artists", but felt that "the real disparity is her inability to reconcile the adult-contemporary 
						schmaltz of I Am with the more modern, edgy sounds of Sasha Fierce." Adam Mattera of The Observer felt that both discs lack depth, observing that the first is "too busy 
						chasing radio formats to expose any genuine soul", and criticizing the second disc's "succession of independent woman anthems such as 'Single Ladies' and 'Diva', which 
						will no doubt inspire drag queens the world over but leave most others bemused." AllMusic's Andy Kellman called its double-disc "gimmick" "flimsy" and favored its 
						second disc's "decent, if easily forgettable, upbeat pop." He expressed that on the I Am... disc, "Beyonce feels each line to the fullest extent, which almost rescues 
						the set's staidness." In his consumer guide for MSN Music, Robert Christgau named it the "dud of the month", indicating "a bad record whose details rarely merit further 
						thought". He found its "split-personality bit" to be "deeply vapid", only observing "three good songs on this 11-track artifact". </p>

						<p id = "parallaxtext" style = "padding-top: 30px"> Jonah Weiner of Blender commented that "Beyonce is still a beauty-shop feminist, quick with the smack-downs, 
						and she still describes the rattling rush of love with preternatural poise". Stacey Anderson of Spin commented that its first disc "meanders over [...] down-tempo 
						cuts" and called ... Sasha "an intriguing but diluted direction". The Village Voice's Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond felt that the I Am... disc lacks cohesion, but 
						complimented "Sasha Fierce as "brassy, big-headed, confrontational, and witty," and stated, "each incendiary track challenges you to leave your inhibitions at 
						coat-check." Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone noted that its slow songs are "full of bland self-affirmation and saggy lines", but wrote that "the "Sasha" 
						disc boasts Beyonce's most adventurous music yet". Colin McGuire of PopMatters called the album "a little rough around the edges at times" and viewed its Sasha 
						Fierce disc as "a far more compelling trip down dance-lane". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the album offers "two compelling sides" of Beyonce
						and stated: "The collection might have been better served had she edited it down to one disc, rather than belabor what ultimately seems like a marketing gimmick. 
						And while fans will surely speculate, there's little in the lyrics that feels more revealing than previous emotional fire-starters." Sasha Frere-Jones from The New Yorker
						found the album to be "something of a mess", mostly because the alter ego "trips on the idea of redefinition". </p>

						Were a Boy' and 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)' are undoubtedly album highlights; still, the surprise here is how consistently satisfying the rest of it is - 
						even the less showy tracks blossom on repeated listening." Mark Edward Nero of About.com ranked it at the ninth place on his list of the Best R&B Albums of 2008. 
						Christian Gerard of NBC Washington placed I Am... Sasha Fierce on his list of "Honorable Mentions" while writing the list for the Best Albums of 2008.
