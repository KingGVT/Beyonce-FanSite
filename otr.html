				<h2 id = "caption"> On the Run Tour </h2>
				<p id = "text" style = "padding-top: 30px"> <strong>The On the Run Tour</strong> was a co-headlining stadium tour by American performer Beyoncé and rapper Jay-Z. The joint 
				tour came shortly after the two had finished their own solo tours — Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and Jay-Z's Magna Carter World Tour (both 2013–2014). 
				The tour's name spins off from the 2013 song "Part II (On the Run)", included on Jay-Z's album Magna Carta Holy Grail, on which Beyoncé features. An official poster 
				for the tour was released along with the announcement of the venture, showing Beyoncé and Jay-Z embracing whilst dressed in black ski masks, following the criminal 
				"on the lam" narrative found in the couples' 2002 first single together, "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" and "Part II (On the Run)". To promote the tour, a faux movie trailer 
				video was premiered in May 2014 entitled "Run" (stylized as "RUN"). The video, which features eight celebrity cameo appearances, showcases the couple in a variety 
				of Bonnie and Clyde style, action and gun packed situations. The tour itself was noted to follow this same theme throughout, with similar video interludes 
				incorporated into the production of the show. Critics generally lauded the tour, praising the extravagant set list, dynamic and detailed theme and story of the 
				show and both artists' performance abilities, however some felt the on stage chemistry between the couple was not what it could have been. Due to the large 
				demand and tickets selling out in minutes in multiple locations, extra tour dates were added to the itinerary. The tour became a commercial success, grossing 
				$96 million in the first 19 North American shows and $109.7 million in total as well as attendance totalling at 979,781. It was the fifth highest-grossing 
				tour of 2014, according to Pollstar's annual year end tour chart. The show was broadcast in its entirety on September 20, 2014, airing on the US television 
				network HBO, following the taping of the two concerts in Paris, France, where the tour concluded. </p>

				<h2 id = "caption"> Development </h2>
				<p id = "text"> The tour was "conceived and launched fast compared to most stadium tours" according to Live Nation, who noted that most tours of this nature 
				take more than a year of planning, compared to the On the Run Tour that took around one month. "It came together quite quickly, around mid-March", Omar Al-Joulani 
				of Live Nation North America commented. "By April, we had everything together, and once the routing was in place we had about three weeks until the tour was 
				announced." Following the general sale of tour dates, fans were left concerned as the July 11, 2014 show in East Rutherford, New Jersey remained pending to go on 
				sale for many weeks, despite all other dates already being available to the public. Some reports stated that the reason for this was that the state of New Jersey 
				had implemented a legislation resulting in 95% of tickets for an event having to be available to the public. The show was eventually put on sale to the public 
				on June 4, 2014. The On the Run Tour was the first tour to be a part of "Official Events" – the collaboration of Facebook and Live Nation in which the size and 
				scale of Ticketmaster's database is leveraged as events promoted by Live Nation are imported to Artists' Facebook Pages as "Official Events", providing fans with 
				direct links to Ticketmaster to purchase verified tickets. </p>

				<p id = "text" style = "padding-top: 30px"> The tour was stated to have a running theme throughout the performances of being "on the run" by the Miami New 
				Times, whether it is from "the media, their place in pop music, the haters, the bullshit and sometimes even each other". When explaining the concept of the 
				tour and its accompanying videos in a telephone conversation to New York-based director Dikayal Rimmasch, Jay-Z stated "We're not trying to do this literally, 
				it's not that we're Bonnie and Clyde. We're on the run from everything. On the run from becoming a cliché. On the run from doing the same thing again." 
				During their individual performances, Beyoncé was often backed by both male and female dancers and Jay-Z was noted to hold the stage for multiple songs 
				without assistance. Beyoncé was backed by an all female band during her solo songs, whilst Jay-Z was accompanied by other male instrumentalists; however 
				both artist's musicians collaborated for the majority of the performance. Video interludes filled with "cop chases and other violent outbursts" carried the 
				storytelling between songs. The performances of the joint tour was said to be split up similarly to Jay-Z's previous joint venture with Kanye West, 
				the Watch the Throne Tour. Beyoncé and Jay-Z would take turn holding down the stage, beginning with several songs by Beyoncé first, followed by 
				duets and afterwards Jay-Z rapping his songs. Both artists sported multiple outfits from a variety of fashion designers throughout the 
				performances of the tour. In Beyoncé's case, makeup artist Sir John Barnette commented on her quick changes backstage between performances, 
				comparing them to "Daytona 500" with every member of her team working on a separate part of her look. </p>

				<h2 id = "caption"> Fashion </h2>
				<p id = "text"> Both Beyoncé and Jay-Z sported multiple outfits throughout the different performances of the tour. One of the more prominent designers 
				for the tour was Versace, in which Beyoncé wore both a fishnet and leather Atelier black bodysuit (complete with a plunging neckline, a fishnet head 
				mask and high heel combat boots), as well as a colourful Atelier bodysuit from the designer. The leather Atelier black bodysuit took approximately 
				200 hours to craft and was used for the opening number of the tour, "'03 Bonnie & Clyde". The colourful bodysuit was commented on by Versace who 
				stated that the team had their inspiration from the street for the colour and added various crystals and stripes to show a "baseball vibe" while 
				also trying to capture Beyoncé's energy. Beyoncé's tour shoes were designed by Stuart Weitzman and Joker's Closet. Other outfits included a denim 
				jumpsuit and a bedazzled leotard bodysuit that "showed off her derrière". Beyoncé also sported more thematic and dramatic pieces of clothing, 
				including a full bridal veil and a sweeping train made of a black-and-white American flag. The American flag outfit was designed by Riccardo 
				Tisci of Givenchy and took over 500 hours to create. The American flag train was 16.4 feet long but weighed around 500 grams allowing it to 
				fly in the wind. The individual stars on the outfit were hand-embroidered and its inspiration was said to be "American Danger: Bonnie & Clyde with 
				a modern twist." For the performance of "Ring the Alarm", Beyoncé returned to designer Vrettos Vrettakos (with whom she collaborated with notably 
				on her previous solo tour). Designed by Dennis Kolpodinos, Vrettakos produced a red, "couture 'crystal spirit' bodysuit" complete with fringe 
				details on the limbs and "embellished with Swarovski crystals for stage-ready shine". </p>

			<div class = "textcontainer">
				<p id = "text" style = "padding-top: 30px"> Alexander Wang designed a "bondage body suit" worn by Beyoncé during the show, as well as multiple pieces by 
				Nicola Formichetti for Diesel. One of these included the previously mentioned denim outfit, which was "made from the company's patented Jogg Jean material, 
				accented with hand-applied hardware and studwork, Swarovski crystal elements and black leather accessories", worn for the performance of "Run the World (Girls)". 
				Formichetti commented on the outfit, saying "Every classic cops and robbers story blurs the lines between the good and bad, we wanted Beyoncé's to be both. 
				Her look is one part police officer and two parts jailbait." Another piece designed by Diesel was an outfit consisting of jean-shorts and a leather jacket 
				embroiled with the word "Texas". Biker gangs that developed in the United States after World War II served as an inspiration for the outfit; Beyoncé's was 
				meant as a tribute to her hometown and a reminder of her roots. It took 4–5 hours to add the word Texas to the leather jacket. The bondage bodysuit was 
				described as "a riff off of an urban bomber hoodie jacket that was cropped to expose a bondage bodysuit underneath that has graphic cutouts. When worn up, 
				the oversized hood covers the face, adding an incognito element reminiscent of the On The Run theme." It also contained snakeskin seamed into the sleeves 
				of the outfit. One of the more controversial pieces worn by Beyoncé during the On the Run Tour was a black, thong leotard that "put her bare rear end on display 
				in a kind of cage-like cutout". Erica Schwiegershausen of The Cut blog wrote that the number was a "somewhat disorienting look". During the performance of 
				"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", Beyoncé revisited a leotard from the song's music video in a black and gold lace bodysuit designed by Michael Costello 
				who wanted "Beyoncé to feel beautiful, strong, super sexy and ventilated" with the outfit. Lebanese designer Elie Saab created a bridal-themed, white long-sleeve 
				lace-embellished jumpsuit for Beyoncé for the performances of "Resentment" and "Love On Top" which was part of his Pre-Fall 2014 collection. Jay-Z's fashion was 
				noted to be Kanye-esque, with pieces worn by him including rotating ensembles of black leather as well as "giant, billowing pant scarves". For the opening 
				performance, Jay-Z appeared on stage in black sunglasses, gold chains, a black and white star speckled shirt and a black jacket. During the performance of 
				"Big Pimpin'" Jay-Z wore a fedora. </p>

				<h2 id = "caption"> Promotion </h2>
				<p id = "text"> The tour was officially announced on April 28, 2014, via Jay-Z's Facebook page. Announcements shortly followed through Beyoncé's website and an 
				official press release. Pre-sale tickets for fans to secure their seats first before the general sale were sold through Beyoncé's website and Chase credit and 
				debit card users exclusively. A writer for Billboard noted that Chase was a surprising candidate for the official tour sponsor due to their lack of experience 
				in the concert industry when compared to the live music sponsorship giants such as Citi and American Express. Chase allegedly scored the "11th-hour" deal due to 
				previous connections with Roc Nation Sports (owned by Jay-Z) and a $4 million bid on the position. A promotional poster for the tour was revealed showing Jay-Z 
				and Beyoncé embracing and wearing ski masks, following the criminals-on-the-lam narrative of the couple's two singles ("'03 Bonnie & Clyde" and "Part II 
				(On the Run)"). Beyoncé also wore a similar ski mask in her 2013 video "Superpower" featuring Frank Ocean from her self-titled album. A second promotional 
				poster was released on May 30, 2014, in an email to fans announcing the on sale times for certain tour dates. The poster features Beyoncé dressed in a white, 
				short-cut wedding dress whilst sitting behind and hugging Jay-Z on a motorcycle. </p>

				<p id = "text" style = "padding-top: 30px"> Following the tour's announcement, it was revealed that $1 from each ticket sold and a portion of certain VIP 
				ticket proceeds would go to the Shawn Carter Foundation (named based on Jay-Z's birth name), which would help and support existing students of the foundation 
				that represent diverse backgrounds, and face significant barriers to success such as teen pregnancy, homelessness, poverty, former incarceration, sexual and 
				domestic abuse, and gang membership. Fans in Houston, Texas were requested to bring preservable goods to a selected location by Beyoncé as part of her 
				"#BeyGood" campaign, in association with the Houston Food Bank, Miss-A-Meal, The Bread of Life and Majic 102.1, to help work towards eradicating the nearly 
				870,000 Houston families suffering from hunger. Fans who donated to the campaign resulted in a chance of winning some of the best tickets in the house for 
				the On the Run Tour in Houston, at Minute Maid Park. The campaign "exceeded expectations", with 2,500 people donating over 10 tonnes of food. </p>

				<p id = "text" style = "padding-top: 30px"> On May 17, 2014, an official video in a faux movie trailer style starring Beyoncé and Jay-Z was released entitled 
				"Run", featuring "Part II (On the Run)" serving as background music. The video, which features multiple celebrity cameos including Don Cheadle, Guillermo Díaz, 
				Jake Gyllenhaal, Kidada Jones, Rashida Jones, Blake Lively, Emmy Rossum and Sean Penn, shows Beyoncé and Jay-Z out on a Bonnie and Clyde expedition, filled 
				with action, crime, love and guns. Multiple other snippets of tracks from Magna Carta Holy Grail carry the video, alongside "Part II (On the Run)". 
				The video notably ended stating "coming never", indicating that the trailer was in fact never going to be a full feature film. The video was directed by 
				Melina Matsoukas. One of the many outfits worn by Beyoncé in the video was a Givenchy lace pant suit, and was commented to add an angelic feel to the contrasting, 
				violent run of the narrative. </p>

				<h2 id = "caption"> Concert synopsis </h2>
				<p id = "text"> The concert opened with a black-and-white video on the screen accompanied by sirens as Beyoncé and Jay-Z appeared onstage surrounded by smoke. The duo 
				started performing the song "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" with Beyoncé wearing a fishnet see-through mask and Jay-Z wearing black sunglasses, a star-speckled shirt, black 
				jacket and gold chains. The pair went on to perform "Upgrade U" as the second song during the set. The opening run from "'03 Bonnie & Clyde to "Upgrade U" set the tone. 
				"Crazy in Love" was performed by the duo among purple lights, smoke, and strobe lights with funky horns in the background. After the performance of the song, "Diamonds 
				from Sierra Leone" began and Beyoncé left the stage as Jay-Z continued singing. He performed "Niggas in Paris" alone on stage before being quickly joined by 
				Beyoncé again for the performance of "Tom Ford". She returned to the stage with a military cap and sang the background vocals for the song. A performance of "Run the World 
				(Girls)" followed with Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's words from "Flawless" appearing on the screen and the latter song was sung by the singer while dancing with her 
				background dancers. A short snippet of "Yoncé" was performed afterwards. An a cappella performance of "Big Pimpin'" followed accompanied by vintage videos and party 
				scenes on the screen with Jay-Z wearing a fedora. Beyoncé performed "Naughty Girl" dressed in a bodysuit as she was immediately joined by Jay-Z for "Big Pimpin'". </p>

			<div class = "textcontainer">
				<p id = "text" style = "padding-top: 30px"> Beyoncé appeared on stage seated in a glass chair, wearing a full-length sequined bodysuit and performed dancehall 
				choreography to "Ring the Alarm" before continuing with "On to the Next One" along with Jay-Z. "Clique" followed with Beyoncé dressed in hooded leather as montage 
				of war images and fireballs were shown on the screen. During the song, Beyonce shortly sang a remixed version of her "Diva" and went on singing "Baby Boy". She 
				reappeared on stage dressed in a black drop-sleeve lace for the performance of "Haunted". "Drunk in Love" was performed with Beyoncé doing a chair dance and Jay-Z 
				appeared during the end to rap his verse. "Public Service Announcement" and "Why Don't You Love Me" followed with the latter performance being accompanied by the 
				French dancing duo Les Twins. For "Holy Grail", Justin Timberlake's vocals in the studio version were replaced with Beyoncé's. "Partition" featured a new rap verse 
				sung by Jay-Z and Beyoncé performed it with a pole choreography along with other female dancers. A video with allusions from "Part II (On the Run)" showing Beyoncé 
				covered in blood in a lineup and glass shattering preceded "99 Problems". "If I Were a Boy" followed with a cover of Lauryn Hill's "Ex-Factor" afterwards. Beyoncé 
				moved to a stage in the middle of the stadium dressed as a bride in white with a floor-length bridal veil and continued with a performance of "Resentment" seated. 
				She continued with "Love on Top" which was performed as a tribute to Michael Jackson. </p>

				<p id = "text" style = "padding-top: 30px"> "Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)" was performed by Jay-Z with black and white shots of Brooklyn. Beyoncé appeared on 
				stage again to perform "Pretty Hurts" in a leather-studded jacket with the word "Texas" emblazoned across the back. The pair moved to the mini-stage for the 
				performances of "Part II (On the Run)" and "Young Forever". Home videos of the couples' daughter Blue Ivy appeared on the screen and an image of "The Carters" 
				written in the sand followed. One of the short projections on the screen showed footage of the pair's wedding ceremony in April 2008 along with their "IV" 
				tattoos, as well as a pregnant Beyoncé showing her bare stomach, with Jay-Z behind, putting the surrogacy and fake pregnancy rumors that have appeared since 
				2011 to rest. "Lift Off" was performed as the last song on the set, serving as an outro. During the performance, Beyoncé changed her costumes numerous times. </p>

			<div id = "reception" class = "textcontainer">
				<h2 id = "caption"> Critical reception </h2>
				<p id = "text"> The opening night of the tour received generally positive reviews: USA Today's Erica K. Landau praised the Miami concert, summarizing it as 
				"[a] tantalizing spectacle, [with] triumphant vocals, palpable sensuality and booty-shaking anthems". She further described the performance as integrated 
				adding that, "the coordination is not just remarkable, it's the absolute best way that two of the world's best performers can deliver a show that proves why 
				they're on top together". MTV News editor Rebecca Thomas praised the duo's united performance, adding that they demonstrated how to share a stage, 
				"egos aside: They toggled, repeatedly, and mostly seamlessly from one megastar catalog to the other and took fan-favorites in surprising new directions — 
				ones that imbued them with pathos that hadn't been there before." Miami New Times Kat Bein felt that the chemistry between the couple was not what it could 
				have been, with Beyoncé reportedly shaking off Jay-Z's kisses or turning away during his "doting playfulness", however Bein added that this could have been 
				merely a playful act for the stage. She felt that potential "witty banter" between the couple was lost with the use of the video pieces between the songs. 
				Jon Caramanica in a review for The New York Times opined that each entertainer gave the other the opportunity to be the center of attention, while acknowledging 
				their different types of success. He concluded "Jay-Z allowed for breezy enjoyment; Beyoncé demanded full and reverent attention". </p>

			<div class = "textcontainer">
				<p id = "text" style = "padding-top: 30px"> The following concerts for the duration of the tour were also met with high praise from critics: Merecedes J. 
				Howze of New Pittsburgh Courier praised the "consistent" show in Cincinnati, stating "The duo has proven numerous times that their union, professionally and 
				personally, is unstoppable." Howze concluded that the show was definitely a "couples concert" meant to be "enjoy[ed]" with a love partner. CityBeat's Jac Kern, 
				who attended the same show praised the duo for performing hard while fully using both of the two stages and interacting with the crowd. However he also felt that 
				intimate moments between the couple on stage were "possibly staged". The production of the tour was stated to be both large and minimal by The Boston Globe writer 
				James Read who commented that only a few performers could manage to pull off a production of On The Run's scale. He continued his review, "Nor is there much to 
				behold beyond its stars: no long catwalks, elaborate sets, or even a visible band. With Beyoncé and Jay-Z, two natural-born entertainers, you do not need much 
				more." Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press reported that the set list of the show emulated a conversation told through songs; he noted that despite the 
				concert being a collaborative tour, "it was the performers' emotional solo material that made their presence as a collaborative duo strong and resilient". 
				The first Canadian show of the tour was again well received by critics. Graham Slaughter of the Toronto Star concluded in his review, "If there's anything 
				to be learned from the On the Run tour, it's that tight timing, a dynamic storyline and legendary talent make a 42-song concert not just enjoyable, but rather 
				unforgettable. Performers be warned: the bar on dual concerts has forever been raised." Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times who attended the first of two 
				shows in Pasadena, California, also gave a positive review noting that the concert showcased how a marriage should work with the spouses "balancing out each 
				other's weaknesses with individual strengths" on stage. Ali went on praising the stage interactions between the pair such as kissing and toggling and concluded, 
				"Whether it was a carefully orchestrated act or not, they are a great team." </p>

			<div class = "textcontainer">
				<p id = "text" style = "padding-top: 30px"> The only European shows in Paris, France, were also lauded by critics. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave 
				the second Parisian show a five star review. He praised the performance abilities of both artists, explaining "When left to [Jay-Z's] own devices 
				on stage, the rapper is forceful and beguiling. It takes little for him to have thousands waving their hands to 'Tom Ford', as he looks dapper in 
				honour of the designer. But when Beyoncé rises up out of the stage in a denim military outfit to the question 'bad bitch?' and then storms into 'Run 
				The World (Girls)', the track's sentiment couldn't resound more. Without doubt, she lives up to her hype as one of the world's best performers. 
				Slick movement, tight choreography, innocent attitude and effortless vocals instantly escalate the atmosphere of the show." Simon Harper of Clash 
				felt that both performers had immediately apparent different performance approaches and both commanded an "incredible presence and deafening screams 
				from the French crowd", however concluded that Beyoncé just finished on top as the better of the two, finalising his all positive review with "The 
				music world's most powerful and influential partnership couldn't fail to demonstrate the reasons for their rise to dominance... As the On The Run 
				tour comes to its conclusion, it's clear to see that Mrs. Carter emerges on top. But damn, it was a good race to watch." </p>

				<p id = "text"> In July 2014, it was announced that HBO would exclusively air the On the Run Tour in full at some point in September, following the upcoming 
				filming of the concerts in Paris, France at the scheduled September 12 and 13, 2014 shows in the city. The shows were shot by music video director Jonas Åkerlund 
				and aired on the channel on September 20, 2014. HBO used 20 different cameras to record the two shows. The concert special received a 0.5 rating of adults aged 
				18–49, and aired to 888,000 viewers. Following the airing of the special, videos of the performances of "Young Forever" / "Halo" and "Flawless (remix)" featuring 
				Nicki Minaj, were uploaded to Beyoncé's official YouTube and Vevo account. In September 2014, it was announced that a trilogy of videos entitled "Bang Bang" 
				were to be released as a short film leading up to the broadcast of the tour special. The short film (in which multiple scenes are found in video interludes 
				and backdrops throughout the tour) was directed by New York-based filmmaker and photographer Dikayl Rimmasch. Together with war photographer William Kaner, 
				Rimmasch put together the filmmaking approach and aesthetic of the series. Inspired by French New Wave cinema, the short film was created using custom camera 
				rigs that Rimmasch had designed, 50-year-old Russian lenses and lighting effects by Archie Ciotti and Scott Spencer and followed an incredibly fast, 
				shoot-from-the-hip recording style. However, following the release of part one of the trilogy, the remaining two videos never came to surface on their 
				scheduled release dates. When asked about this (and the deletion of part one from its original upload source), Rimmasch simply stated "no comment". 
				In February 2015, all 3 videos resurfaced online, debuting on creativeexchangeagency.com. </p>

				<p id = "text"> Tickets for the tour were priced at $40 to $275, so that wherever fans were on the "ticket chain", they had an opportunity to 
				attend the show. "We made sure we had affordable tickets as well as the higher-priced tickets that we know the market can bear. Pricing went right across 
				the spectrum", promoters explained. Jesse Lawrence of Forbes stated that demand for the tour was "through the roof" and that the On the Run Tour was "guaranteed 
				to be one of the biggest tours in recent years." Shortly after pre-sales for the tour began, tickets had already started to appear on the secondary ticketing market. 
				In the same article, Lawrence explained how with an average ticket price of $342.67 on the secondary market, the On the Run Tour was "head and shoulders above 
				the rest", having a higher average ticket price than both Beyoncé and Jay-Z's previous aforementioned solo tours, Jay-Z's previous co-headlining tours with Justin 
				Timberlake and Eminem, as well as The Monster Tour; the then upcoming co-headlining tour from Rihanna and Eminem. Billboard reported that the On the Run Tour was 
				"already one of the summer concert season's hottest engagements" and noted that tickets had sold out in minutes for multiple dates. Due to the large demand, extra 
				dates were added in East Rutherford, San Francisco and Pasadena following the first shows in each city selling out. The second Rose Bowl stadium date in Pasadena, 
				California, again had to await approval from the Pasadena City Council for the aforementioned reason that the Rose Bowl has a cap of twelve events per year and all 
				other events exceeding this limit require approval from the city council. On June 13, 2014, two Paris dates of the tour were announced, set to be performed at the 
				Stade de France. The dates were labelled as the exclusive, only European shows of the On the Run Tour. Within two hours of going on general sale, 90,000 tickets 
				were sold between the two Paris shows. Stephanie Smith of Page Six reported that Beyoncé and Jay-Z were paid $4 million per show of the tour, "guaranteed and 
				independent of ticket sales". This totalled to a $84 million total payout to the couple throughout the duration of the tour. </p>

				<p id = "text" style = "padding-top: 30px"> Live Nation reported to Billboard that the tour had already sold 750,000 tickets and was on pace to reach 850,000 
				total tickets sold in North America. It was also noted that the tour was averaging close to $5.2 million per show in current sales and that the On the Run Tour 
				would finish as "one of the most successful tours of the year". On the same day, Forbes reported that the summer tour would most likely finish as the second 
				most successful tour of all time by one measure when looking at the average gross per show, which then stood at a predicted $5 million. In August 2014, Omar 
				Al-Joulani of North American touring for Live Nation confirmed that the On the Run Tour had officially passed $100 million in ticket sales in the 19 North American 
				shows alone, with attendance topping out at more than the previously predicted 850,000. Al-Joulani also noted the triumph of the tour outside of the "must play" 
				markets such as New York City or Los Angeles, stating the tour routed into some secondary touring markets like Cincinnati, New Orleans and Seattle "that turned 
				out to be wildly successful". "We had the greatest time in those markets" said Al-Joulani. In September 2014, the North American leg of the tour was individually 
				reported to Billboard Boxscore. Beyoncé and Jay-Z landed atop of the Hot Tours chart with 19 sold out shows. The most commercially successful performances of 
				the tour were venues with double bookings, found in East Rutherford, grossing $11.5 million, Pasadena grossing $10.9 million and San Francisco, generating $8.8 
				million. The tour was announced as the 5th highest grossing tour of 2014 in Pollstar's annual highest grossing tours chart, with a total revenue of $109.7 million. 
				The tour also had a total attendance of 979,781 and an average attendance of 57,634 per city. </p>
