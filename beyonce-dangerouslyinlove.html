						<p id = "parallaxtext" style = "padding-top: 30px"> <strong>Dangerously in Love</strong> is the debut solo studio album by American singer Beyonce. It was released worldwide on June 24, 
						2003 through Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment and in the United Kingdom on June 23, 2003. During the recording of Destiny's Child's third studio 
						album Survivor (2001), the group announced that they would produce solo albums to be released. Recording sessions for the album took place from March 2002 to 
						March 2003 at several studios, during the hiatus of her then-group Destiny's Child. As executive producer of the album, Beyonce took a wider role in its 
						production, co-writing a majority of the songs, choosing which ones to produce and sharing ideas on the mixing and mastering of tracks. The tracks in the album 
						are a mixture of uptempo songs and ballads, which are basically inspired by R&B and soul genres; it also features elements of hip hop and Arabic music. 
						Although Beyonce remained discreet about her interpretation of the songs, its underlying meanings were attributed by music writers as an allusion to her 
						intimate relationship with then-boyfriend and well-known music mogul Jay-Z. Dangerously in Love received positive reviews from music critics upon its release, 
						with critics praising Knowles' "artistic leap". The album also received numerous accolades, earning Beyonce five Grammy Awards at the 46th Annual Grammy 
						Awards on February 8, 2004. Dangerously in Love reached a worldwide commercial success, earning multi-platinum certifications in Australia, the United 
						Kingdom, and the United States. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 317,000 copies in its first week, earning Beyonce the 
						highest debut sales among Destiny's Child members' solo albums. Dangerously in Love has sold over eleven million copies worldwide and produced two US Billboard 
						Hot 100 number-one singles – "Crazy in Love" and "Baby Boy" – and two top five singles – "Me, Myself and I" and "Naughty Girl". </p>

						<h2 id = "parallaxcaption"> Background </h2>
						<p id = "parallaxtext"> Beyonce launched her career as lead singer to R&B group Destiny's Child in the late 1990s. According to Corey Moss of MTV News, "fans are eager 
						to see" how Beyonce, after years with the group, performs solo. While recording their third album, Survivor, in late 2000, Beyonce announced the group would be put on 
						hiatus in order for the members to produce solo albums in the coming years, which they hoped would boost interest in Destiny's Child. The idea of individual releases 
						emanated from the group's manager and Beyonce's father, Mathew. With different types of music for each member to produce, the albums were not intended to compete on 
						the charts. Destiny's Child's management strategically planned to stagger the release of each group member's album to maximise sales. Michelle Williams was the first 
						to release a debut solo album, Heart to Yours, in April 2002. Meanwhile, Beyonce debuted on the big screen, starring in the comedy film Austin Powers in Goldmember, 
						and recorded her debut single, "Work It Out", which is featured on the soundtrack to the film. Rowland collaborated with American rapper Nelly on the song "Dilemma" as 
						a featured artist; it became a hit that year, leading the label to advance the release date of her debut solo album, Simply Deep, in late 2002. Beyonce also starred in 
						The Fighting Temptations and recorded another solo single. In August 2002, she collaborated with boyfriend Jay-Z as featured vocalist on the song "'03 Bonnie & Clyde". 
						The single earned Beyonce credibility and paved the way for the release of Dangerously in Love. </p>

						<h2 id = "parallaxcaption"> Recording </h2>
						<p id = "parallaxtext"> Before Beyonce began recording for Dangerously in Love, she selected the producers with whom she would collaborate. For two days, 
						she held meetings with prospective producers from the West Coast across the East Coast, and had interviews with them. Beyonce went to Miami, Florida to 
						begin sessions with Canadian record producer Scott Storch, her first collaborator, and lived in a Miami hotel in the following months. As she wanted 
						to concentrate on the album, Beyonce took her time to avoid pressure build-up, significantly different from the hasty productions of Destiny's Child.
						As she did on Survivor, Beyonce took a wider role in the production of Dangerously in Love, co-writing a majority of the songs, choosing which ones 
						to produce and sharing ideas on the mixing and mastering of tracks. Although Beyonce did not create beats, she came up with melodies and ideas she 
						shared with the producers. With 43 songs completed - 15 of which made it to the album - Beyonce is credited as co-writer and co-producer, as well 
						as the album's executive producer alongside Matthew Knowles. Beyonce felt that recording an album without her group mates was "liberating and 
						therapeutic", coming into the studio and freely expressing her ideas with her collaborators. The dependency she developed with Destiny's Child, 
						however, meant it was harder "to be on [her] own creatively". As she wanted to grow as an artist Beyonce contacted other artists with a view to 
						forming a collaborative partnership. When the collective finished writing several songs, she printed copies of each and sent them to prospective 
						guest artists. She talked to them by phone for possible collaboration, eventually gaining their approval. Besides Jay-Z, Beyonce was able to work with 
						Jamaican artist Sean Paul, American rapper Missy Elliott, among others. In contrast, some artists sent copies of songs to Beyoncé, which were eventually 
						produced. Additionally, Beyonce also worked with Timbaland and Missy Elliott on a track titled "Wrapped Around Me" for the album. Eventually, however, 
						for reasons unknown, the song failed to appear on the album. Dangerously in Love was originally a song of the same title which Beyonce had written for 
						Survivor. The song was deemed too sophisticated compared to other songs on Survivor, and the group decided not to release it as a single off the album. 
						After recording several tracks for Dangerously in Love, Beyoncé decided to add "Dangerously in Love", after realizing that it fit the overriding theme 
						of the album. Since the album's release date was postponed to capitalize on the success of "Dilemma", Beyonce had been offered the chance to further 
						enhance the album. Although she was disappointed with the move, Beyonce realized that "everything happens for a reason", agreeing to return to the 
						recording studio to work with other songwriters. This allowed her to record more songs, including the album's lead single, "Crazy in Love". 
						In late 2002, Beyonce paused working on Dangerously in Love for a holiday tour with Destiny's Child. With a few weeks left for recording in March 2003, 
						Beyonce was still collaborating with other guests on the album, including Sean Paul and P. Diddy. </p>

						<h2 id = "parallaxcaption"> Music and lyrics </h2>
						<p id = "parallaxtext"> Beyonce's mother-manager Tina Knowles said that Dangerously in Love showcases her musical roots. While Williams and 
						Rowland were on gospel and alternative pop, respectively, Beyonce focused on recording R&B songs. Songs in the album are varied: from mid-tempo 
						and club-oriented tracks in the first half, and ballads in the second half. Beyonce commented: "My album is a good balance of... ballads and... 
						mid-tempos with just ridin'-in-your-car feels, to a lot of... up-tempo club songs, to really sexy songs, to songs that make you feel emotional. 
						It's a nice mixture of different types of tracks." Although the album contains high-energy songs like "Crazy in Love" and "Naughty Girl", the 
						album's focal mode, however, is slow and moody. Beyonce said that she had written lots of ballads for the album. According to Beyonce, she wanted to 
						be understood as an artist and showcase her range, and by doing so, she blended various genres and musical influences in the album. The album incorporates 
						R&B, hip hop, soul and reggae influences. The album took hip hop influences from Jay-Z, Outkast, and Lil' Kim; the reggae is from Sean Paul; and courtesy 
						of Storch, the album explores Arabic music. His personal study of that kind of music gave the album a Middle Eastern vibe. Beyonce and the producers also 
						used a wide array of instrumentations. </p>

						<p id = "parallaxtext" style = "padding-top: 30px"> When "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" was released as a single in late 2002, critics and the public had speculated that 
						Beyonce and Jay-Z were having a mutual affair. Despite widespread rumors, they remained silent about their relationship. According to critics, the title itself 
						of the album sounded "more intriguing" with Beyonce singing personal songs. Though love is the theme Beyonce had incorporated in the album, "most the material 
						is vague enough to be about any relationship"; however, there are songs that suggested affirmation of their relationship. In the song "Signs", Beyonce sings about 
						being in love with a Sagittarius, which coincidentally is Jay-Z's zodiac sign. In response to the persistent rumors about them, Beyonce stated, "People can come to 
						whatever conclusion they like... That's the beauty of music... I'm a singer, I'll talk about writing songs all you want. But when it comes to certain personal 
						things any normal person wouldn't tell people they don't know, I just feel like I don't have to [talk about it]." Beyonce said that Dangerously in Love is lyrically 
						similar to Destiny's Child's albums. But because she only had to write for herself, Beyonce had the chance to compose personally deeper songs than her previous 
						records with the group. With a theme that is based upon different stages of a romantic relationship, Dangerously in Love contains songs that speak of love and 
						honesty. In addition, Beyonce admitted that there are songs about love-making. The personal content of the album, however, was not generally attributed to 
						Beyonce's own experiences-although some were based from hers-instead, the theme kept recurring in her mind. Beyonce later explained: "I wanted to have an 
						album that everyone could relate to and would listen to as long as I'm alive and even after... Love is something that never goes out of style. It's something 
						everybody experiences, and if they are not in love, people usually want to feel that..." While some songs merely focus on the "beauty of love", the album also 
						explores another side of love, with songs that "celebrate breakup" and songs that narrate a woman's desire to have a degree of control in a relationship. The album's 
						hidden track, "Daddy", is a tribute to Beyonce's father, Mathew Knowles, who fronted Destiny's Child as their manager. The song is an account of Beyonce wanting her 
						future husband and child to possess qualities similar to her father's. Originally, Beyonce did not intend to include the track in the album, having thought its 
						lyrics would make her appear immature. However, considering it one of the songs that reflected her life at that transitional moment, she instead relegated "Daddy" 
						as the closing track. </p>

						<h2 id = "parallaxcaption"> Release and promotion </h2>
						<p id = "parallaxtext"> Beyonce said that she had trouble convincing executives at Columbia Records to release the album. The singer recounted that it 
						almost was not released: "In 2003, I had my first solo album. But when I played it through for my record label, they told me I didn't have one hit on my 
						album. I guess they were kinda right, I had five. "Dangerously in Love", "Naughty Girl", "Me, Myself and I", "Baby Boy" and "Crazy in Love"." Since "Dilemma" 
						was concurrently charting atop the Billboard Hot 100, Beyonce's management released, "Work It Out", one of the songs on the soundtrack to Austin Powers in 
						Goldmember, instead of a single from Dangerously in Love to preclude it from possibly competing with the former. From the original release date of October 
						2002, the album was pushed to December in the same year, and to May in the following year. Beyonce recorded a version of "In da Club", and served its way 
						to mixtapes before its original release date. The single failed to dominate as a "dancefloor favorite"; Mathew Knowles, however, confirmed that it was 
						just a "buzz cut" and was not included in the album. Nonetheless, it earned enough airplay to appear on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks 
						chart. While Beyonce was wrapping up the album, several of its songs had leaked online. In efforts to prevent more tracks in the album from being spread 
						illegally, as well as being a victim of bootlegging, Columbia Records, with high commercial expectations from the album, pulled the release of 
						Dangerously in Love to June 24, 2003, two weeks ahead of the planned July 8 release. </p>

						<p id = "parallaxtext" style = "padding-top: 30px"> Buyers who pre-ordered the album online received links where they could download a song called "I Can't 
						Take No More"; the promo lasted until the album's release. On June 14, 2003, Beyonce premiered songs from the album during her first solo concert and the 
						pay-per-view TV special, "Ford Presents Beyonce, Friends & Family, Live From Ford's 100th Anniversary Celebration in Dearborn, Michigan". By the night of 
						the album's release, Beyonce's concert was broadcast in more than twenty theaters across the United States. Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, Tyrese, 
						Solange Knowles and girl group Ramiyah also performed in the show. Beyonce also promoted the album by performing in television shows such as the 
						Saturday Night Live, Late Show with David Letterman, The Today Show, The Early Show, and The View. By April 2003, Beyonce's management was choosing the 
						album's lead single between two songs. Sent to clubs, the song that would receive positive reception would be considered the lead single. Finally, 
						"Crazy in Love" was released as the lead single off the album. With commercial success that included crossover music markets, the single spent eight 
						consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. "Baby Boy" followed, and received greater success than "Crazy in Love". With its dominance 
						on radio airplays, the single surpassed "Crazy in Love"'s chart performance, remaining on the top spot for nine consecutive weeks. "Me, Myself and I" 
						was released as the third single and "Naughty Girl" as fourth and last; although the last two releases only reached the top five on the Hot 100, they 
						all attained immediate commercial success and helped the album earn multi-platinum certifications. Beyonce further promoted Dangerously in Love 
						with her Dangerously in Love Tour in November 2003, performing in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands. Her concert at Wembley Arena in 
						London, England on November 10, 2003 was featured on the DVD included on her live album Live at Wembley, released on April 26, 2004. </p>

						<h2 id = "parallaxcaption"> Critical reception </h2>
						<p id = "parallaxtext"> Dangerously in Love received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized 
						rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on 16 reviews. Anthony DeCurtis of 
						Rolling Stone viewed that it presents Beyonce in two styles, one "far more flattering" than the other, and found the ballad-oriented songs on 
						the album least flattering, commenting that Beyoncе has "plenty of time" to develop the style maturely that would "[make] sense for her". 
						Entertainment Weekly's Neil Drumming commented that the album validates Beyoncе's "taste in innovation". He also viewed that Beyoncе's 
						collaboration with various record producers explores new directions in contemporary music, doing more reinventing than revisiting. 
						Like DeCurtis' review, however, Drumming pointed out that "most of the disc's missteps" are in its latter part. Slant Magazine's Sal 
						Cinquemani wrote that "[Beyoncе] is allowed more room to experiment vocally as a solo artist, exploring softer registers and lathering 
						on the coquettish persona that was only hinted at on Destiny's Child tracks like 'Bootylicious.'". Steve Jones of USA Today stated, 
						"Beyoncе succeeds by showing greater depth as a songwriter and broader range as a singer". Blender's Ben Ratliff complimented 
						Beyoncе's performance and stated, "She's playing the cool-hunter but covering the bases with seraphic arrangements of multiple 
						voices. Her reach is remarkable". Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters called it an "artistic leap" and wrote that it "finds Ms. 
						B in the midst of a fully flowering womanhood and doing the best singing of her career". </p>

					<div class = "parallaxtext">
						<p id = "parallaxtext" style = "padding-top: 30px"> In a mixed review, Vibe magazine's Jason King said that the album occasionally 
						"sounds desperate to reach every demographic". Kelefa Sanneh, writing in The New York Times, felt that it missed the harmonies Beyonce 
						had in Destiny's Child records and that she is more effective "when she's got a posse behind her". Rob Fitzpatrick of NME called it 
						"a cruel glimpse of a talent that occasionally blazes but is frustratingly inconsistent". Uncut called its ballads "self-pitying/self-mythologising", 
						while Q stated, "She has good songs, but no great songs". Los Angeles Times writer Natalie Nichols expressed that it "demonstrates vocal finesse 
						[...] But, especially on the ballads, [Beyonce] often drags things out with diva acrobatics". The Guardian's Adam Sweeting wrote that "the desperate 
						urge to cover every musical base from dancefloor to soul-ballad means that there is barely a track here with any distinctive identity or even a tune". 
						In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau cited "Yes" and "Baby Boy" as the album's highlights and quippedly remarked, "Dangerously 
						in Love ... with her daddy, the bonus cut reveals—as if we didn't know." He gave the album a one-star honorable mention, indicating "a worthy effort 
						consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like." In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine 
						commented that "the first half is good enough to make Dangerously in Love one of the best mainstream urban R&B records released in 2003, and makes a 
						strong case that Beyoncé might be better off fulfilling this destiny instead of reuniting with Destiny". </p>
